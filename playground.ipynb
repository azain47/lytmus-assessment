      "is_difficulty_appropriate=<AppropriateAlignment.YES: 'YES'> is_solution_approach_viable=<AppropriateAlignment.YES: 'YES'> reasoning=\"For difficulty, both the main question and similar questions involve concepts such as set definition, matrix operations (determinants, adjugate matrix properties), and summation of sequences. These are standard topics taught in high school advanced mathematics or early undergraduate linear algebra (e.g., JEE Advanced level curriculum). They do not require any PhD-level knowledge. Therefore, the difficulty is appropriate for students.For solution approach viability, Solution Approach 2 is perfectly viable as Similar Question 2 is an exact duplicate of the Main Question. This approach correctly identifies and applies the key property det(adj A) = (det A)^(n-1) (where n is the order of the matrix), calculates the determinant of A, correctly identifies the elements of the set S, and outlines the required summation. This method directly solves the Main Question. Solution Approach 1, on the other hand, deals with a different type of summation involving determinants (summing elements within the determinant before evaluation) and does not utilize the crucial adjugate property. Thus, Solution Approach 1 is not directly applicable to the Main Question's structure. However, since Solution Approach 2 is a complete and correct method for the identical problem, the overall viability is YES.\"\n"
